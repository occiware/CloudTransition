Artifacts related to the cloud transition analysis

This repository contains the following elements:
* [fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.infrastructure.design](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/tree/master/fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.infrastructure.design): a designer dedicated to Archimate technical infrastructure, later to be extended with costs tooling.
* [fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.infrastructure.sample](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/tree/master/fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.infrastructure.sample): the sample models used to create the representations
* [fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.occi](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/tree/master/fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.occi) and [fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.occi.ui](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/tree/master/fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.occi.ui): an OCCI/Archimate bidirectional bridge prototype
* [Archimate - Impact Cloud Transition.jpg](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/blob/master/screenshots/Archimate%20-%20Impact%20Cloud%20Transition.jpg): A screenshot of the SmartEA infrastructure diagram: an enterprise architecture sample archimate model extended to materialize the use case described in 3.6.1.
* [Archimate - Offers Infrastructure.jpg](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/blob/master/screenshots/Archimate%20-%20Offers%20Infrastructure.jpg) and [Archimate - Trips Infrastructure.jpg](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/blob/master/screenshots/Archimate%20-%20Trips%20Infrastructure.jpg): A screenshot of a new representation of this infrastructure dedicated to the technical architecture, which will be later extended to provide a cost-oriented tooling.
* [OCCI - Sample Configuration diagram.jpg](https://github.com/occiware/CloudTransition/blob/master/screenshots/OCCI%20-%20Sample%20Configuration%20diagram.jpg): The OCCI representation of the sample Archimate model (technical layer). Obtained by converting the Archimate model to a simple OCCI configuration using the OCCI/Archimate bridge prototype (fr.obeo.smartea.archimate.occi).
